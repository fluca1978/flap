 * ##### FLAP - Ferrari Luca's Agent PlatformExample ####
 * 
 * FLAP is mini-mini-micro agent platform I developed in order to introduce
 * students to agent and multi-agents contexts. The platform is designed to
 * help students to learn what are the issues and the main solutions in the
 * agent field. 
 * The platform is intentionally kept simple, its aim is not to be a competitive
 * product but a didactic framework on which students can experiments and debug
 * simple agent and multi-agent applications.
 * Source code represents also a good starting point for a complex project design and
 * can be used as a base to organize other Java projects.
 *
